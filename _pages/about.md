I am an Assistant Professor of <a href='https://www.cs.colgate.edu/'>Computer
Science</a> at <a href='https://www.colgate.edu/'> Colgate University</a>.
Before joining Colgate, I was a Postdoctoral Associate in the <a
href='https://linguistics.mit.edu/'>Linguistics and Philosophy Department</a> at
the <a href='https://www.mit.edu/'>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>. I
received my Ph.D. from the <a href='https://linguistics.cornell.edu/'>Department
of Linguistics</a> at <a href='https://www.cornell.edu/'>Cornell University</a>
where I was primarily advised by <a href='https://vansky.github.io/'>Marten van
Schijndel</a> and my B.A. in Computer Science and Mathematics from <a
href='https://www.columbia.edu/'>Columbia University</a>. 

I am broadly interested in mismatches between our experiences with language and
our knowledge of language. That is, I try to find in linguistic data systematic
deviations from what we might expect given our knowledge of grammar. Findings
like this excite me because they suggest cases where our minds extend beyond
mere correspondence with experience. My primary tool at the moment is
neural language models (e.g., GPT-3) trained on text data. Drawing on insights
from psycholinguistics, linguistic theory, and cross-linguistic variation, I
expose limitations in current AI models and tie these limitations to properties
of training data. My dissertation titled <a href=''>"On the Limitations of Data: Mismatches
between Neural Models of Language and Humans"</a> sketches out my perspective with
case studies.  

Besides research and teaching, I love coffee, watching movies, swimming, hiking,
and skiing. I cohabitate with a cat named Figaro, who spends his time sleeping
throughout our home, sitting on my keyboard, and meowing for food.
